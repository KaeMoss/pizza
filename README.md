This is _emphasis_ this is **bold**

when writing code inline it's a good idea to backtick like `let(i=0; i<backtick.length; i++)`

If writing quite a bit of code you should use three backticks and announce which language is being used:
```javascript
  let sillyWalk = [Eric Idle, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam];
  console.log(sillyWalk);
  ```
  
  You can just write a number to begin an ordered list(you can even use the same number and markdown will change it to be ordered):
  1. I
  1. am
  1. writing
  1. in
  1. markdown

For unordered lists use an asterisk:
* Oaxalis
* Pothos
* Sago Palm
* Bouganvillia

Write links with [] and ().  This is a link to [evernote](https://www.evernote.com/)

For pictures use ![]() where [] is the alt text.  ![A picture of Taika Waititi looking through a mug handle](https://media.gq.com/photos/59fb767b0401c14f0ef8c191/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Taika-Waititi-Steven-Taylor-GQ-2.jpg)
